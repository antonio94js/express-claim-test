### Main Dependencies

A shortly description of the main dependecies used on the code challenge. (Only the new ones)

* [Ramda] - This module let us use all the power of the functional programming, like curry, lexers, transducers, partial application, immutability, etc.
* [Passport] - A powerful tool that make the auth process a little bit easier with all its strategies.
* [bcryptjs] - All the user password are saved encrypted, because of that, It's necesary to use bcryptjs to decrypt them.
* [winston] - Great tool for handle logs into the STDOUT and STDERR
* [Sinon] - Have ever need to mock something? Well Sinon is the answer bro.

### Getting Started
----
#### Clone the project

First at all you need to clone this code challenge

`$ git clone project`
`$ cd express-claim-test`

#### Install dependencies
You can install the dependencies with yarn or npm (I honestly always prefer yarn)
`$ yarn`
`$ npm install`

#### Load your Environment Variables

You will need to create a .env file and set the Environment Variables listed in the above table or load them manually through the **export VAR=VALUE** command.

**When you change NODE_ENV between development and test , you must remember to change the value of the DB_DATABASE Environment Variables to avoid migration problems**

#### Prepare the Environment

You will need to run the sequelize migrations and seeders. By this time only the user table is loaded with seeders.

**IMPORTANT:** The user's password must to be encrypted, you can use https://bcrypt-generator.com/ to generate your encrypted password and save them trought the seeders process.

If you have the sequelize cli installed globally you can do:

`$ sequelize db:migrate`
`$ sequelize db:seed:all`

Otherwise you should do:

`$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate`
`$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all`

#### Run the project

`$ yarn start`
`$ npm start`

#### Run the test

`$ yarn run test:unit`
`$ yarn run test:integration`
